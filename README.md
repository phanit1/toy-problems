This is the one which is used for testing LRU cache in python.
An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently 
used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit.
Firstly, I thought about the variables which i want to declare in constructor and declared and committed it
Next, I declared empty methods which I required
Next, I wrote some testcases to test this concept code
Then, I wrote logic to the methods by practicing on a LRU problem
Here I experienced A bug that in assert statement that I compared list with a string
Then I resolved that bug and updated it.
